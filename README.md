# ITP449
Coursework and challenge projects from ITP 449 - Applications of Machine Learning

This repository features various assignments and extra credit projects from ITP 449, a course for my Applied Analytics Minor. The assignments had varying levels of direction and the challenges had little to none.  Each file is a different ML method (mostly classification) working on some of the classic datasets (Titanic, Iris, Boston Housing, etc).
